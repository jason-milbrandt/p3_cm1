These files incluce additional modifications that I (JM) prefer to use
but will not be included in "formal" mods to CM1r21.1 for new P3 interface
(i.e. as candidates for r21.2)

cm1.F
- new values of nout2d and nout3d for diagnostic output
- nwrite = 0, such that first output file (time 0) starts at cm1out_000000.nc

init3d.F
- modified location of w-forcing for iinit = 12

param.F
- includes modified path (./data_files) as input in call to p3_init
