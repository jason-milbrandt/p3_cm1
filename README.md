## P3-CM1
This respository contains modified code to CM1 to interface P3. Each subdirectory for a given CM1 version contains only CM1 files that have been modified for the P3 interface, with the intent of having no impact on CM1 if any other microphysics scheme is used.

For the official CM1 code and other documentation, see links at:
- https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/cm1

This code is for general CM1 interface maintenance.  The original focus was on the hail modeling
project, started at NCAR in September 2022 (Milbrandt et al. 2025, JAMES).

- ported changes into files for cm1r21.1, Aug 2025
